# Machine Learning Models for Diamond Price Prediction
This project involves the development and evaluation of multiple machine learning models to predict diamond prices. The dataset consists of features that describe diamonds, potentially including their carat, cut, color, clarity, depth, table, x (length), y (width), and z (depth). These features are used as inputs to train the models. The primary goal is to find the model that best predicts the price of a diamond based on these features.

Models Used:
1. Linear Regression
2. k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN)
3. Boosted Trees
4. Random Forest
5. XGBoost
